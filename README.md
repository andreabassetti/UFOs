# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana set up a webpage and a dynamic table to better filter the information and create a better user experience. Now, in addition to the date, the user will be able for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:

The new webpage has been designed to include more filters in order to refine the search for each user. To the left of the table there are 5 filters. When the webpage is opened, they default to not filter for anything. The grey text in the filters is simply their to guide the user. To use the filters, simply add text to each filter and the page will automatically filter when you press enter or click out of the text box. If you need to reset the page at any point, simply scroll to the top of the page and click on 'UFO Sightings'. A full layout of the webpage can be seen below.

## Summary: 

A drawback of this new design is that the filters are extremely case sensitive. The text must be entered exactly as it appears, or the filters will not work. This means that the user must scroll through the data set to find what they are looking for and then type it exactly as it appears. I would recommend that this be resolved by adding lists to the filters instead of requiring the user to type their search. I would additionally also recommend that the filters for 'Date' be broken up by day, month, and year. This will allow the user to achieve the desired level of detail in their search.
